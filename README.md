Repository for a project of the course Autonomous and Mobile Robotics at La Sapienza University. This project was completed by Isabella Claire Adriani and Christian D'Amico.

Aim of the project was comparing relative strength and weaknesses of two humanoid robots gait generation algorithms. The first was the Intrinsically Stable - Model Predictive Control (IS-MPC) approach developed by the la Sapienza laboratory (http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~labrob/research/StableMPC.html). The second is a step adapter module developed by the Italian Institute of Technology (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10403.pdf).

As part of the project students were tasked with implementing the step adapter methodology and compare its performance with a provided implementation of IS-MPC.

Of course, a step adapter cannot work in a vacuum: it requires an external base algorithm. For this reason, students had to implement a footstep planner, a consequent plan for the trajectories of Zero Moment Point and Divergent Component of Motion and a control Algorithm for the Center of Mass of the robot.

Final output of the project was a report (available here) and a Powepoint presentation.
